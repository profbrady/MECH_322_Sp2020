# import the necessary modules

# write a function named `map_level` that reads the light 
# level value and maps it to a 0 - 1.0 value such that
# a value of 0 correlates to a brightness of 0

    # place your code here for calling your function and
    # assigning the value to the variable `bright` and then
    # setting the NeoPixel brightness using `bright`
