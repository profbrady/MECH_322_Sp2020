    "Create a script named `cpy_2_03.py` using the Circuit Playground device simulator extension in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You will submit the script file and a screen recording that demonstrates you testing the script on the simulator to the assignment in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use commands from the `adafruit_circuitplayground` module to turn your CPX/CPB board into a night light using the built-in NeoPixels, slide switch, push buttons, and capacitive touch pads.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the slide switch is in the `False` position the CPX will simply act like a flashlight with the brightness intensity set to 100%. In this mode all of the NeoPixels should be set to white `(255, 255, 255)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the slide switch is in the `True` position the CPX will act like a night light of sorts. The brightness of the NeoPixels should be reduced to 50% in this mode. Buttons A and B and the capacitive touch pads perform the following tasks in this mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Button A pressed and lights on: immediately turn **off** all of the NeoPixels\n",
    "\n",
    "- Button B pressed and lights off: immediately turn **on** all of the NeoPixels (50% brightness)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capacitive touch pads A4, A5, A6, or A7 touched and lights on: turn off the 10 NeoPixels one at a time with a 0.25 second delay between turning off each NeoPixel. Use a `for` loop to accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capacitive touch pads A1, A2, or A3 touched and lights on: lower the brightness of the 10 NeoPixels by 5% (0.05) every 0.25 seconds until they are completely off. Use a `for` loop to accomplish this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code in `cpy_2_03` uses a variable to keep track of when the lights are on or off (`lights_on`). It is initially set to `False` and the NeoPixels are turned off. Any time the lights are turned off, this variable should be set to `False`. Any time the lights are turned on, it should be set to `True`. Only monitor for button A being pressed and the capacitive touch pads being touched if the lights are on. Only check for button B being pressed when the lights are off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the provided `cpy_2_03.py` file as a framework. Be sure to change the comment at the top of the script to use your name."
