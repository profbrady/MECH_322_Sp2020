    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a script named `cpy_3_03.py` using the Circuit Playground device simulator extension in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You will submit the script file and a screen recording that demonstrates you testing the script on the simulator to the assignment in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use commands from the `adafruit_circuitplayground` module to create a countdown timer on the CPB board that uses the built-in push buttons and slide switch to set the time and start/stop the timer. The NeoPixels will be used to display the timer setting and the countdown in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the slide switch is in the left position to set the timer. The timer can be set in 10-second increments up to a maximum of 100 seconds by pressing the A and B buttons. Pressing A will increase the timer value and pressing B will decrease it. Use NeoPixels to indicate the timer setting as it is set. For example, when set to 30 seconds, the third NeoPixel (`cp.pixels[2]`) should be illuminated. Use a brightness of 0.5 and a color of blue for NeoPixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placing the slide switch in the right position puts it in run mode. In this mode, pressing the A button should start the timer, but only if a timer value has been set. When the timer expires flash all of the NeoPixels red at a 0.2-second on, 0.2-second off rate (the provided video also plays a tone, but the virtual CPX cannot play tones). Pressing the B button should turn off the lights (and stop the tone if we could play one) as well as reset the timer. The B button should also stop the timer and reset it if pressed before the timer has expired. Switching from run to setting mode should also stop the timer as well as turn off the NeoPixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a timer value has been set and the slide switch is set to run mode, illuminate all 10 NeoPixels as soon as button A is pressed. The NeoPixels should be green if the timer setting is for 20 seconds or more and red if only 10 seconds. Then turn one off the NeoPixels one at a time at one second intervals starting with index position 9. Do the same for each 10 second interval of the countdown except for the last 10 seconds, where the NeoPixel color should be changed to red to express that the countdown is almost done. Using nested `for` loops might be a good choice for performing the countdown task. If you do use nested `for` loops, make sure you check the status of button B and slide switch inside the loop(s) so you can `break` if either of them change states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will be more efficient and easier to create if you use a *state variable* to keep track of whether the timer has finished counting down. For example, setting `timer_complete = False` before the main loop and anytime the timer is reset. Only set it to `True` after the countdown has completed. This can then be used as a trigger for flashing lights (and buzzing). Also, maybe create a function that can be called to reset the timer value to zero, change timer complete state variable to `False`, and turn off all of the NeoPixels (and stop the tone if it were available).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the provided `cpy_3_03.py` file as a framework. Be sure to change the comment at the top of the script to use your name."
